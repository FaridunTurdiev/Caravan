Image saving suggestions

Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):

Utilize CDNs like Azure CDN or AWS CloudFront to distribute static assets, including images, to users worldwide.
Optimize Image Sizes:

Implement image optimization libraries or services within your .NET backend, such as ImageMagick or the .NET Core Imaging Library.
Consider using Angular image optimization libraries like ngx-image-compress to further reduce image sizes on the client side.
Implement Caching:

Leverage caching mechanisms within your .NET backend using libraries like MemoryCache or OutputCache to cache image responses.
Explore Angular caching techniques using HTTP interceptors to cache image requests on the client side.
Lazy Loading:

Implement lazy loading of images in your Angular frontend using libraries like ngx-lazy-load-image.
Content-Based Image Storage:

Store images in cloud storage solutions like Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3 and serve them directly to users from these services.
Image Optimization Tools:

Integrate image optimization tools into your .NET backend as part of the image upload process to ensure that images are optimized before storage.
Use Angular image optimization libraries to further optimize images on the client side.
Implement Image Versioning:

Append version numbers or timestamps to image URLs in your .NET backend to facilitate cache invalidation and ensure clients fetch the latest versions.
Security Considerations:

Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms within your .NET backend to control access to image resources.
Ensure secure transmission of images over HTTPS and validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
Monitor and Optimize:

Use monitoring tools like Azure Application Insights or AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance of your .NET backend and Angular frontend.
Monitor image-related metrics such as response times, cache hit rates, and bandwidth usage to identify areas for optimization.
Backup and Disaster Recovery:

Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures for your image storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage) to ensure the availability of image assets in case of data loss or server failures.
